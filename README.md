# MAPF-project
MAPF project about abstraction

## TO DO:
- [x] add 2-3 benchmark instances
- [x] modify asprilo for 8-connected grids
  - [x] change definition of direction
  - [x] add crossing collision
- [ ] implement:
  - [ ] abstraction WIP
    - [x] cliques
    - [ ] orphans
    - [ ] connectedness of cliques
    - [ ] visualisation (clingraph)
    - [ ] level
  - [ ] solving of abstraction
  - [ ] extending asprilo with constraints from solved abstraction
- [ ] run benchmarks
- [ ] try other abstraction:
  - [ ] corridor
  - [ ] crossroads
  - [ ] like in G-TAPF paper
